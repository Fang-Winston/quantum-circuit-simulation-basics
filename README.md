# quantum-circuit-simulation-basics

This project explores basic quantum circuits and simulations using Qiskit.  
It focuses on simple gates, Bell states, and visualizing measurement results.

## Project Goals
- Learn and simulate fundamental quantum gates (X, H, CNOT, Z)
- Create and visualize entangled states (Bell states)
- Understand circuit depth, measurement, and basic noise effects

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Getting Started
1. Install Qiskit:
```bash
#pip install qiskit
```
2. Open bell_state.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell to simulate quantum circuits and visualize results.

## Expected Results
- Circuit diagram of Bell state preparation
- Measurement histogram, e.g., {'00': 521, '11': 503}
